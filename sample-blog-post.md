Even though Google's AI Mode and AI Overviews are essentially using similar technology (custom Gemini model) and query fan out technique to build the generate the answers but a recent study from **BrightEdge** finds otherwise.

Here is what this study found

**AI Mode:** Brands show up in 90% of responses, surfacing 3.8x more unique brands.

**AI Overviews:** Brands are mentioned 43% of the time in responses, and there is 30x higher week-to-week volatility.

**Citations:** AI Mode leans on 5 to 7 source cards; AI Overviews have 20+ inline citations per response.

And according to BrightEdge brands need to understand this difference and think of it in this way.

**AI Mode:** A broad, stable discovery engine. Lower entry barriers. Predictable patterns.

**AI Overview:** A selective, fast-shifting curator. Heavy citation density. A testing ground for visibility.

Based upon this study, here is what brands should do?

## Adapt Content Strategy Based on Mode Visibility

Optimize content and brand assets for both AI Mode (broad, stable discovery) and AI Overviews (selective, high-volatility curator) to maximize presence across both modalities.

Focus on maintaining visibility in AI Mode, since brands appear in 90% of responses (vs 43% in AI Overviews).

## Leverage AI Mode for Brand Discovery

Monitor and improve brand mentions in AI Mode answers, as it surfaces 3.8x more unique brands. I've been using **SE Ranking's Google AI Mode Tracker** for this.

## Monitor Competitor Mentions and Visibility

Use the competitive research features which are offered by different AI visibility tracking tools nowadays to analyze how often and where competitor brands are appearing in AI Mode and AI Overviews. This is really important to understand if and when to adjust your own strategy.

## Focus on Localized Search Strategies

Utilize the location focus in AI Mode (cities/regions) to optimize content for specific local search intents and monitor local brand performance. This is really important if you are a local services provider, like many of **my SEO clients** just target locations Melbourne and Sydney because that's where they provide their services.
